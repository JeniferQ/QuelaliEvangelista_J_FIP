# FIP - Final Integrated Project - Level 1

**Objective:** This repo was created for the Final Integrated Project of the first term of the Interactive Media Design program. The project required the creation of two mobile web pages for the Couples Resort website. My choice of pages was the Rooms page and the Dining page. Both pages are linked to the menu, and functionalities were implemented based on an Adobe XD prototype.
